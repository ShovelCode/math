Math needs to be in words. Good for text files and source control.

1. A set is an unordered collection of objects.

George Cantor lived from 1845 to 1918. He went insane at the end.

2. The objects in a set are called the elements or members of a set. A set is said to contain its elements.

3. Look upon these: natural numbers, integers, positive integers, rational numbers, real numbers

4. The universal set is all elements under consideration

A data type in computer science is a set.

5. A function is a set of ordered pairs, two functions whose graphs intersect are just that, a single point, or a single set of ordered pairs is the intersection of those two sets.
